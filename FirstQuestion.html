            The Amrita School of Computing, a premier constituent of Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, 
            is recognized for its commitment to academic excellence and research-driven innovation.
            With campuses across Amritapuri, Bengaluru, Coimbatore, Chennai, Kochi, and Mysuru,
             the school offers a diverse range of undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs, 
             including specialized tracks in Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, and Data Science.
              Accredited with an A++ grade by NAAC, the institution blends technical rigor with a "Compassion-Driven Research" philosophy,
               encouraging students to develop technological solutions for societal challenges such as healthcare, sustainability, and disaster management.

           The school is well-regarded for its robust industry connections and impressive placement record, consistently attracting top-tier global recruiters like Microsoft,
            Amazon, and Cisco. In recent cycles, students have secured high-value packages,
